[Introduction to github.com/twilio-internal](https://internal-product-docs.twilio.com/docs/scm/twilio-internal/intro)

## NEW USER?

> [!IMPORTANT]
The first step to gaining access to the twilio-internal is to follow the instructions here:
>
> [QUICKSTART: Onboarding to GitHub.com/twilio-internal](https://internal-product-docs.twilio.com/docs/scm/twilio-internal/quickstart)


After completing the Onboarding steps, GitHub will automatically synchronize some of your team memberships from Okta within 30 minutes. _Until this has completed, you will not be able to see any private repositories._

> [!NOTE]
> 
> If you have followed the onboarding instructions and waited 30 minutes and still cannot see any private repositories, reach out for help in #help-github.
